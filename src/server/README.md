To run, it is necessary to set required values in .env file, in order to connect to database and gain access to sources from Usermap API (credentials can be acquired from [Apps Manager](https://auth.fit.cvut.cz/manager/index.jsf)). 

Then - assuming you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed - you can simply run

* `npm install` to download dependencies

* `tsc` to compile JS files or `tsc -w` to run compiler in watch mode  

* `npm start` to run the app(nodemon)
